## [Unreleased]

### Added

- M0: Repo scaffolding — `engine/` uv-managed FastAPI project skeleton, placeholder
  `web/index.html`, Docker/Compose deployment files, and project docs (`PLAN.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- M0: `GET /api/health` endpoint serving the engine version, and static hosting of `web/`.
- M1: Data layer — `DataSource` protocol, `YFinanceSource`, and a parquet-backed
  `CachedSource` (cache dir via `FUNNEL_DATA_DIR`, default `data/cache/`); the
  31-asset default universe (`funnel.data.universe`) with min-history filtering.
- M1: Strategy library — 47 strategy families (19 trend, 12 mean-reversion, 6
  volume, 3 volatility, 4 pattern, 3 composite) under a strict causal-only,
  no-look-ahead position contract, plus a shared hand-rolled indicator module
  (no TA library dependency).
- M1: `funnel.strategies.grid` config builder — 150 (strategy, parameter-set)
  configs across all six categories, with `total_backtest_count` and
  `summarize_grid` for transparent "N configs × M assets = K backtests" reporting.
- M2: Backtest engine (`funnel.backtest.engine`) — `strategy_returns` turns a
  position series into net daily returns (position_t applied to the t→t+1
  close-to-close return, transaction costs charged exactly on position changes
  via `|Δposition| × bps/1e4`), plus `cost_bps_for` mapping asset class to the
  configured per-side cost rate.
- M2: Metrics (`funnel.backtest.metrics`) — `sharpe`, `max_drawdown`,
  `drawdown_duration`, `trade_count`, `cagr`, and `win_rate`, all on daily
  return/position series with documented edge-case behavior (zero/near-zero
  variance and empty series return 0.0 rather than NaN/inf).
- M2: Walk-forward validation (`funnel.backtest.walkforward`) — `walk_forward_oos`
  splits an asset's history into 5 contiguous, near-equal windows, each
  independently recomputed from its own 70% in-sample / 30% out-of-sample
  split (indicators warm up strictly within each window, never leaking
  pre-window history), stitching all OOS tails and IS heads into combined
  series. Raises `InsufficientHistoryError` when any window's OOS segment
  is too short (< 30 rows), which the sweep runner catches and records as
  a skipped pair.
- M2: Six-filter survival funnel (`funnel.backtest.funnel`) — `apply_funnel`
  evaluates all six filters (max-DD floor, min/max OOS Sharpe, the
  OOS/IS overfit-signature gap, min OOS trades, positive IS Sharpe) from
  `FunnelThresholds`, always recording all six per-filter outcomes even
  after an earlier failure.
- M2: Sweep runner (`funnel.backtest.sweep`) — `run_sweep` runs every
  (config, asset) pair through walk-forward + the funnel into one DataFrame,
  printing the "N configs × M assets = K backtests" transparency line;
  `write_sweep_results` writes `sweep_results.csv`.
- M2: Attrition report (`funnel.reports.attrition`) — `build_attrition_report`
  computes total/skipped/survived counts and per-category/per-family survival
  rates and mean OOS Sharpe from the raw sweep DataFrame, embedding the exact
  `FunnelThresholds` applied; `render_text`, `to_dict`, and
  `write_funnel_report` (→ `funnel_report.csv`) expose it as text, dict, and CSV.
- M3: Parameter sensitivity (`funnel.robustness.sensitivity`) — per-family
  mean/std/positive-fraction of OOS Sharpe across parameter configs
  (curve-fit red-flag detection); `write_sensitivity` → `sensitivity.csv`.
- M3: Bootstrap stress test (`funnel.robustness.bootstrap`) — drawdown
  percentiles and worst-case drawdown from order permutations of each
  survivor's stitched OOS returns (sequencing risk), Sharpe p5/p50/p95 from
  with-replacement resamples, deterministic under a fixed seed; solid/fragile
  verdict against the funnel's max-DD floor; `write_bootstrap` → `bootstrap.csv`.
- M4: Cross-sectional momentum research check (`funnel.momentum.cross_sectional`)
  — monthly (21-day) rank of the universe by trailing return at 3m/6m/12-1
  lookbacks, long top third / short bottom third with turnover costs, scored
  with the identical 5-window walk-forward discipline; side-by-side comparison
  against single-asset momentum families and a plain-language verdict; flagged
  research-only (long/short conflicts with the no-short tradeable track);
  `write_cross_sectional` → `cross_sectional.csv`.
- M5: Regime detection (`funnel.regime`) — `Regime` (trending/choppy),
  `RegimeDetector` protocol, and four causal detectors: 200-day MA filter,
  expanding-quantile realized-vol, ruptures change-point (expanding refit),
  and a 2-state Gaussian HMM on [return, vol] with periodic expanding-window
  refits (never fit-on-full-then-label-the-past); detector comparison and
  agreement matrix; `regime_conditioned_metrics` and
  `write_regime_performance` → `regime_performance.csv`.
- M6: Strategy layer stack (`funnel.layers`) — position sizing (volatility
  targeting and ATR risk sizing, both causal, leverage-capped at 1.0),
  uncorrelated-signal combining with greedy correlation-bounded selection,
  and regime routing (zero exposure outside a strategy's preferred regime);
  `run_stack` with independent `LayerToggles` per layer and
  `attribution_table` isolating each layer's marginal Sharpe/drawdown/
  win-rate contribution → `layer_attribution.csv`.
- M6: Portfolio view (`funnel.portfolio.correlation`) — pairwise strategy
  correlation matrix with a minimum-overlap guard and redundancy flags for
  highly correlated pairs → `correlation_matrix.csv`.

- M7: Risk/reward profiles (`funnel.profiles`) — four validated 0–100 sliders
  with the hybrid mapping: drawdown-tolerance and risk-tolerance hard-map
  onto funnel thresholds (max-DD floor -0.15…-0.50, Sharpe ceiling 2.0…4.0,
  min trades 40…20, all linear and monotone), capital and time-horizon
  soft-re-rank only (crypto niche penalty, turnover preference); per-slider
  `explain_mapping` for UI display; two presets ("Retirement Core",
  "Swing Sandbox") plus atomic JSON profile persistence; profile-aware
  screener with hard-constraint flags (research-only long/short excluded
  from the tradeable track) and an intraday-unsupported warning.
- M7.5: Pipeline orchestration (`funnel.pipeline`) — one call runs
  data → profile thresholds → sweep → attrition → sensitivity → bootstrap →
  cross-sectional → regime → layer attribution → correlation → screen,
  writing all artifacts (seven CSVs + `layer_attribution.csv` +
  `report.json`) under `runs/<id>/`; zero-survivor runs complete honestly
  with warnings recorded, never swallowed.
- M7.5: API — profiles CRUD, `POST /api/runs` (serial background jobs with
  per-stage status mirrored to `status.json`), status/report/artifact
  endpoints (artifact-name whitelist and strict run-id validation guarding
  against path traversal), live `GET /api/mapping/preview` for slider
  feedback, and a `FUNNEL_FAKE_DATA=1` synthetic source for offline UI dev.

- M8: catfu single-file SPA (`web/index.html`) — zero-build instrument-panel
  UI per AESTHETIC_CONTRACT.md: profile deck hero (four keyboard-operable
  faders with LCD readouts, preset snap, live mapping readout from
  `/api/mapping/preview`, intraday warning), run console with per-stage LED
  progress, and report views for funnel attrition (direct-labeled stepped
  bars + exact thresholds applied), robustness (sensitivity + solid/fragile
  bootstrap verdicts), cross-sectional (research-only banner), regime
  (single-hue agreement matrix), layer attribution, and correlation
  redundancy — every section with CSV artifact downloads, honest zero-state
  handling, dark/light rocker theming, and WCAG AA-verified contrast.
- M8: `.claude/launch.json` dev-preview config (uvicorn on port 8731 with
  synthetic data via `FUNNEL_FAKE_DATA=1`).

- M9: Docs — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (module map, 12-stage pipeline, artifact
  and endpoint inventory, env vars), `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md` (honest gaps:
  real-data path untested in the network-blocked dev env, Docker build
  unverified without a daemon, options overlay deferred to v2, intraday
  unsupported in v1), and a README refresh with the fake-data dev mode.
- M9: `.dockerignore` now excludes `data/` (local cache/profiles) from
  image builds.
- V2-M1: Options pricing core (`funnel.options.pricing`) — Black-Scholes-
  Merton price/delta/risk-neutral P(ITM at expiry) with documented q=0
  total-return-frame ground rules (model prices, never market prices;
  "assignment probability" is always the labeled model P(ITM) proxy),
  closed-form strike-for-delta via Acklam's inverse-normal approximation,
  and a strictly causal realized-vol proxy (`synthetic_iv`) with a
  configurable volatility-risk-premium multiplier and floor. Golden-value,
  put-call-parity, monotonicity, edge-case, round-trip, and
  truncation-invariance tests.
- V2-M2: Overlay roll engine (`funnel.options.overlays`) — daily-grid
  simulation of covered calls, cash-secured puts, credit vertical spreads,
  and LEAPS with per-cycle capital-base normalization (documented per
  structure) so overlay Sharpe/drawdown are comparable to buy-and-hold;
  DTE/delta/%OTM strike selection, scheduled and model-P(ITM)-triggered
  assignment-avoidance rolls, expiry settlement with assignment events,
  commission + synthetic-spread costs on every open/close, and structural
  defined-risk enforcement (`UndefinedRiskError` — unbounded-loss specs are
  unconstructible). Hand-computed roll fixtures, bounded-loss proofs for
  all four structures, look-ahead guard, and cost-monotonicity tests.
- V2-M3: Overlay grid + validation (`funnel.options.grid`, `.sweep`) —
  36-config grid across the four structures; walk-forward scoring of
  overlay AND buy-and-hold returns on identical windows (v1's 5-window
  70/30 stitched-OOS discipline), bootstrap stress with solid/fragile
  verdicts, warmup-aware skip handling (valid-row, not raw-row, window
  counting), and `overlay_results.csv` where every row carries
  `model_priced=True` and the labeled `mean_model_prob_itm` column —
  upside forgone and negative vs-hold Sharpe are always present, never
  filtered.
- V2-M4: Overlay run type + API — `run_overlay_pipeline` (symbol-scoped
  fetch, min-history filter, sweep, `overlay_results.csv` + `report.json`
  with `run_type: "overlay"` and an always-embedded model-risk caveat),
  `POST /api/overlays` (universe-validated symbols, ≤10, same background
  job/status/artifact machinery incl. run-id traversal guards),
  `GET /api/overlays/universe` for the UI picker; strategy reports now
  carry `run_type: "strategy"`.
- V2-M5: OVERLAYS deck in the catfu SPA — asset-class-grouped symbol
  chips (≤10), run console with stage LEDs, a permanent amber model-risk
  banner rendering the report caveat verbatim, and the yield-vs-assignment
  results table (premium yield, labeled model p(itm), assignments/rolls,
  overlay vs buy-and-hold OOS Sharpe with the Δ column always prominent,
  upside forgone, bootstrap verdict pills) with sort controls, honest
  empty/zero states, per-structure summary strip, and CSV download;
  run-type routing via report.run_type with a localStorage registry.
- V2-M6: v2 docs (architecture module map, overlay run type, endpoints;
  README feature paragraph; OPEN_ITEMS model-risk entry) and a watched
  real-data overlay run in the rebuilt container (AAPL+MSFT: 72 backtests,
  51% negative vs-hold, 62/72 fragile — honest results confirmed).
- V2-M6: Grid fix from the e2e honesty check — `build_overlay_grid()` now
  includes 10 hold-to-expiry (`roll_at_dte=0`) configs (46 total) so the
  assignment/settlement path is actually exercised in production runs
  (previously every config rolled 5 days before expiry, making
  `n_assignments=0` structural and misleading); sweep-level test proves
  nonzero assignments. OVERLAYS UI gained a one-line clarification that
  Δ vs hold compares stitched walk-forward OOS Sharpe, not full-period
  total return.

- Run management — `run_type` ("strategy" | "overlay") now carried in
  `status.json`, every `/api/runs` row, and `/status` responses (legacy
  files read back as "strategy"), so clients never fetch a full report
  just to classify a run; `POST /api/runs/{id}/cancel` with cooperative
  cancellation (`funnel.cancellation.RunCancelledError`, checked at stage
  boundaries and once per sweep iteration) and an honest `cancelled`
  terminal state that never leaves partial artifacts; run listing now
  scans disk once and serves from memory (stale "running" rows from a
  dead process are corrected to errors).

### Performance

- Pipeline compute (PERF-1, profiled before/after on the full 150×31
  synthetic run): total wall time 19.5 min → 7.1 min from (1) fixing a
  redundancy bug that ran every regime detector's `classify()` twice and
  (2) parallelizing the strategy and overlay sweeps across cores
  (`ProcessPoolExecutor`, `n_workers` on PipelineConfig/OverlayRunConfig,
  deterministic submission-order assembly, serial path preserved and
  proven identical via exact-equality tests, cancellation still prompt
  via `cancel_futures`). Further cut to ~2 min by bounding the
  change-point comparator (`ChangePointDetector(max_window=1000)` in the
  pipeline — ruptures PELT degrades toward O(n²) on the expanding 15-year
  window, measured ~674 s vs ~66 s bounded). NOTE: the bounded window is a
  semantic change to the change-point *diagnostic only* (HMM still does
  all routing/conditioning); set `max_window=None` to restore the old
  behavior. Bootstrap left as-is (measured ~1 s, not worth touching).

### Performance (PERF-2, measured)

- Threshold-independent compute cache: the sweep's walk-forward metrics and
  the regime detectors' labels never depend on profile thresholds, so both
  are now cached on disk keyed by a fingerprint of the actual inputs (data
  content hash, grid, walk-forward, costs, detector params) plus an
  engine-version + schema salt (code changes can never serve stale
  numbers). Cache hits skip the computation entirely and re-apply only the
  cheap threshold verdicts — proven byte-identical to fresh runs. Every
  report discloses `compute_cache` hit/miss and the UI shows a "cached"
  chip; `use_cache: false` forces a fresh run. Warm sweep 0.07 s (was ~6 s),
  warm regime 0.04 s (was ~7 s).
- Changepoint comparator now uses PELT `jump=10` (new knob, was hardcoded
  5): verified on real SPY 2010–2025 inside the container — 3.9x faster
  with 0.0000% label difference.
- Sweep pools use `forkserver` on macOS (fork remains on Linux); the four
  `.rolling().apply()` indicator families (linreg_slope, aroon, hull_ma,
  connors_rsi) are vectorized with exact-parity tests against verbatim
  reference implementations; universe data now fetches on an 8-thread pool
  (with a fixed race in the yfinance csrf-fallback flag, now lock-guarded).
- Net effect on the synthetic full grid (150×31): cold 57 s → 8.3 s; warm
  (slider change) → 3.6 s.

### Fixed (adversarial review findings)

- CRITICAL — overlay daily returns could fall below -100% (mark-to-model
  P&L divided by a capital base frozen at cycle entry), silently corrupting
  Sharpe/drawdown/bootstrap for gapped positions (reproduced at -320%/day
  with shipped LEAPS grid params; the old vertical-spread test even pinned
  a -267.6% cycle "return" as correct). Overlay returns now use
  within-cycle equity compounding — `cumprod(1+r)` reproduces the true
  dollar equity path exactly (verified against an independent re-derivation
  to ~1e-16), every daily return ≥ -100%, with a documented dead-position
  floor for near-zero equity. NOTE: overlay metrics legitimately shift
  versus earlier reports — the old numbers were wrong under gaps. New
  gap-fixture and compounding-identity tests lock the convention in.
- Job registry: stale-"running" recovery now checks process liveness
  (`pid` recorded in status.json, `os.kill(pid, 0)` probe, biased toward
  never falsely erroring a possibly-live run) so a second instance sharing
  a runs volume cannot poison a live run; foreign running runs are re-read
  from disk until terminal.
- Regime report/UI now disclose that the change-point comparator uses a
  trailing 1000-day window while the other detectors use full history
  (`comparison_caveat`), so agreement-matrix disagreement is not
  misread as purely a detection difference.
- Parenthesized the multi-exception `except` in the overlay sweep (PEP 758
  comma form is valid but visually ambiguous; `# fmt: skip` guards against
  ruff format rewriting it back).

### Fixed (UI batch, user-reported)

- Run rows now carry a run-type chip and route predictably (strategy →
  FUNNEL, overlay → OVERLAYS) using the API's `run_type` field; the
  report-fetch-based classification and its localStorage registry were
  removed. Cancelled runs render dimmed and unclickable (no report exists).
- Performance: loaded reports are cached in memory (re-selecting a run is
  a 0.5 ms no-op with zero network calls vs a full refetch+render), list
  renders batch through DocumentFragments, and heavy tables use
  `content-visibility: auto`.
- Light-mode legibility: new theme-adaptive `--green-text`/`--amber-text`
  tokens (dark = the lit tokens; light = darkened variants at ≥4.8:1
  measured contrast) for all chassis semantic text — a documented contract
  extension following §3's `--blue-bright` precedent; screens/LEDs keep
  the fixed lit tokens.
- Removed the stray status-bar scrollbar (a 1px `.navlink` height overflow
  coercing `overflow-y: auto`); the pipeline activity bar now stretches the
  full panel width with discrete flex segments.
- LAYERS view: the correlation matrix is now an index-keyed compact
  intensity grid (values on hover) with a legend and a top-correlated-pairs
  list — no horizontal page overflow at 375/768/1280; full matrix remains
  in the CSV.
- RUN FUNNEL / RUN OVERLAYS buttons toggle to STOP RUN while a run is
  active, wired to the cancel API, with "cancelled" shown as a distinct
  honest end state (409 finished-before-cancel race handled).
- Pipeline activity bar now shares a fit-content wrapper with the
  stage-label row, so it ends at DONE instead of stretching the full
  panel (both consoles, verified at 1280/768/375).

### Changed

- Design language switched from "Cyberdeck" to "catfu" (cassette-futurism):
  AESTHETIC_CONTRACT.md replaced; PLAN.md M8 updated (fader-style profile
  sliders supersede the PRD's gradient sliders; contract §13 checklist).

### Fixed

- Docker build: multi-stage Dockerfile — a `build-essential` builder stage
  compiles hmmlearn/ruptures from source (no cp314/linux-aarch64 wheels),
  the runtime stage stays compiler-free; container CMD preloads libstdc++
  (resolved via ldconfig, amd64/arm64-portable) to fix an RTTI
  symbol-visibility crash in hmmlearn's compiled extension under Python's
  RTLD_LOCAL dlopen, and invokes uvicorn from the venv directly (no uv
  re-resolution at container start).
- `.dockerignore` now uses `**/` globs so nested `engine/.venv`, caches,
  and bytecode are excluded — build context dropped from 419 MB to ~5 kB.
- Live data: `YFinanceSource.fetch` now falls back once (per process) to
  yfinance's "csrf" cookie strategy when a download comes back empty —
  yfinance 1.4.1's default "basic" strategy bootstraps via `fc.yahoo.com`,
  which refuses connections on some networks, previously yielding empty
  frames and honest-but-useless zero-asset pipeline runs. The fallback is
  logged, guarded against private-API drift, and covered by offline tests.
- `.gitignore`: scoped `data/` and `runs/` to the repo root (`/data/`,
  `/runs/`) — the unanchored `data/` pattern had been silently excluding
  the entire `engine/src/funnel/data/` package (DataSource protocol,
  yfinance source, cache, universe) from version control since M1; the
  package is now actually tracked.
- Zero-backtest runs on DNS-filtered networks diagnosed and documented:
  `fc.yahoo.com` (yfinance's cookie-bootstrap host) is on common DNS
  blocklists; when sinkholed, every fetch returns empty and the pipeline
  honestly reports a zero-asset run. `compose.yaml` now carries a commented
  `extra_hosts` stopgap and the durable fix (DNS whitelist) is documented in
  `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md`. First real-data run verified end-to-end: 31 assets,
  4650 backtests, 10 survivors.
